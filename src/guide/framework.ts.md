## TypeScript

Define webcomponent `<revo-grid/>` and you can access it property in natural way. Check [Quick start](./) for more information.
Works exactly same way as Vanilla Js, all typings supported from component folder.

`<revo-grid/>` fully based on typescript support. 
It provides transparent type definition with minimal documentation needed for basic understanding of component.

The TypeScript types can be imported with:

```ts
import { RevoGrid } from "@revolist/revogrid/dist/types/interfaces"
```

The types are properties of `RevoGrid` and can be used like this:

```ts
const tableSource: RevoGrid.DataType[] = []
```
